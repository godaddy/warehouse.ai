# Advanced configurations

This document details advanced configurations such as minification, create dependent builds, 
create locale-specific builds, etc.

### Building for multiple locales

Warehouse can create bundles per locale and/or market. This should result in optimized bundles per locale. 
By default any package is built for `en-US`. To enable builds for multiple locales, add the `locales` property
of your module's `package.json`. `locales` should be specified as an `array`. For example:

```js
"locales": [
  "da",
  "de",
  "nl-NL",
  ...
],
```

Locales can be specified with their full [IETF language tag][ietf], which is composed of a 
[primary language subtag][language-subtag] and a [region subtag][region-subtag], or their primary language subtag alone.

Each locale will run as a separate build. The build will set the locale to environment variables. These are
`process.env.WRHS_LOCALE` and `process.env.LOCALE`, preferably use the latter. You can refer to
the environment variables directly in your webpack configuration.

### Debugging a build

If your build failed to complete for some reason, you can first inspect the result of each step
through the build status. Run the following command to get a detailed description of each step.

```js
wrhs get:status [moduleName] dev -e
```

The results from a successful build can be found below. Warehouse has some built-in retries for some steps.
This can be seen in the `wrhs` CLI output below with the `ERROR` for  `npm install`.

```

### Minification

By default all builds for `test` and `prod` environment will have their JS and CSS minified. This ensures that 
any asset used in production will always be minified and has an associated `sourcemap` that refers to the same 
hashed filename. You still get full control over minification [through `wrhs.toml`][setup-wrhstoml]. The 
configuration below will be passed along to [uglifyjs], which Warehouse uses for minification. The properties 
(i.e. `compress`) match the properies `uglifyjs` expects from its configuration. Minification is done before 
pushing to CDN, so you still can expose [non-minified files only for `test`][setup-wrhstoml].

```ini
[minify]
[minify.compress]
unsafe = true
dead_code = true
collapse_vars = true
drop_console = true
conditionals = true
booleans = true
unused = true
if_return = true
join_vars = true
```

### Dependent builds

If you have multiple customer facing modules that should always depend on the latest version of one of
your team's modules. Warehouse provides a feature to rebuild dependent modules after the dependency they all
have in common is published. If the dependent module is published to Warehouse, Warehouse will
[rebuild the dependent module][rebuild] after the dependency is built.

However, if you need to depend on a module, say `module A` depends on `module B`, but do not want your dependent 
module (`module A`) to rebuild each time a new version of your dependency (`module B`) is published, specify the 
dependency (`module B`) as a `devDependency` in the `package.json` of  your dependent module (`module A`). 
Warehouse will only trigger dependant builds from modules specified under `dependencies`.
